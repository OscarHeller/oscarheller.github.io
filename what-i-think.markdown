I've written up my thoughts on some of the big issues facing Brattleboro. I know every topic here deserves way more than a paragraph, but I wanted to put something down in hard copy. You should know where I stand.

What's more important to me is what you think. I want to hear your story. What's on your mind? What worries you? What are you looking forward to? [Please reach out](/get-in-touch) and let me know!

## Housing

Our housing shortage is a major problem. Everyone knows it, and it informs other problems we have: homelessness, economic development, even mental health and drug issues. Recent Selectboards have been unwilling to take up housing, and I think that needs to change. While we can’t solve the problem on our own, we can play a much stronger role. Declining to invest the ARPA money into housing, despite public support, was a missed opportunity.

## Transportation

Good public transit is so valuable. It helps people get to work and access services; it unclogs traffic which makes driving, walking, and biking safer and our town more attractive; it’s a major benefit to lower income people who struggle to afford a car. I’d like to see us put more money behind the Moover, and make it more attractive with full bus shelters at every stop so that people who have cars will still take it because it’s pleasant, cheap, and convenient. I want it to be easy and fun to explore and live in Brattleboro without ever having to start your car.

## Climate

I feel a moral responsibility to move forward on clean energy and weatherization. And I feel a practical responsibility to move forward on climate resilience and adaptation. The more we can do, the better we’ll be prepared for the hits when they come. That doesn’t just mean energy instability and stronger storms, but economic changes to ski tourism, foliage tourism, and maple syrup production. We need to protect Brattleboro’s future.

## Transparency and listening

I will tell you what I know, and I will listen to you.

That’s easy to say. You’d be hard-pressed to find a candidate for anything, anywhere who doesn’t say it. But I believe philosophically in the principles of democracy and good government. That’s why I’m running. I’ll have to make decisions, and there will be people who wanted me to do the other thing. That’s the nature of government. But I give you my word: I will tell you what I know, and I will listen to you.

## Business development

I want to explore creative ways of bringing businesses back to Brattleboro and filling our storefronts. We can’t deny national economic realities, but not every problem has to be solved on a grand scale. What are the little things we can do to ease the lives of Brattleboro businesses? I run two small businesses and I know that small gestures can be really meaningful when every dollar matters. Let’s bring parklets back. Let’s extend the work of beautifying our downtown with murals and flowers. Let’s put in twenty benches downtown, and if the last public restroom idea was too expensive, let’s get out the duct tape and find a low budget solution. Let’s do active outreach to downtown businesses so that everyone knows all the town resources they could access. Let’s get creative!

## Community safety

I believe that law enforcement is a necessary part of a society of laws. Practically, I think the Brattleboro Police Department has a good record and works hard to avoid the dangers inherent in their role. I also think being a police officer is a hard job, and the police department is often the call of last resort when nobody else will or wants to help. That said, we have to recognize that the history of “the police” as a national institution is deeply stained, and “the police” have been tools of violent and racist oppression. It’s our job as citizens to be vigilant and thoughtful when thinking about the people to whom we give guns and the legal right to use force. I’ll hold both of these beliefs side by side as I consider questions of community safety.

I know that people want “action” on drugs, but I don’t always know what that means. I’d love to hear what you all think on the subject. I think drug dealers should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, but I don’t think the police need the Selectboard to tell them that. Police operations against drug dealers are important, but they're also difficult and slow.

## Social crises

Our town is suffering under the burden of national social crises that feed into each other: homelessness, poverty, drug addiction, and mental health problems. I don’t believe that the Selectboard of a town of 12,000 people can hope to do much more than manage symptoms.

I don’t support criminalizing homelessness or panhandling. Homelessness is not a choice, if that even needs to be said. Behavior that rises to a criminal level has a remedy in the justice system. My understanding is that asking for money is constitutionally protected under the First Amendment and attempts to criminalize it are, among other things, futile.

We need to support the overburdened organizations we’re lucky enough to have. I support our contributions to local human service nonprofits. Organizations like Groundworks and the Retreat and the services they provide are what keep some people off the street, in treatment, in rehab, sober, fed, working, heated, sheltered, and alive. We need them to continue and to thrive.

## EMS and Rescue

EMS was a mess. Like all of you, I’m on the outside looking in. I’ve pieced together my understanding of what happened from bits and pieces, from reporting, from off-the-record discussions. Many of these bits and pieces conflict. I’m confident there’s blame to spare. But I’m not going to speculate about blame when my information is third-hand. I’m not happy or comfortable with what I saw from the outside, any more than you.

However, while things may change, as of the day I write this (February 4th), the town is moving forward. The job of future Selectboards, my job, will be to make it work. It’s going to be complicated and hard. I’ve read hundreds of pages of materials and I’m still no expert. But we can’t throw aside the investment we’ve made. If municipal EMS fails now, we all lose, and lose big. I will work tirelessly towards its success.

I will make it a priority to provide close oversight over every detail of the implementation of our EMS program. That means checking facts and numbers, asking every relevant question, and requiring bookkeeping and reporting to be done in such a way that we can look back and analyze. We need to be able to know if the project is succeeding, struggling, overperforming, or failing. I’ll be watching the whole way, and I’ll make sure the oversight happens in public with the opportunity for comment. That’s important to me.

## The “more meetings” solution

Here’s an idea: if we don’t have time to finish a discussion or fully work out an issue, we can just hold more meetings. Everyone talks a big game on transparency and listening to the public, but it’s easy. Just hold more meetings.
